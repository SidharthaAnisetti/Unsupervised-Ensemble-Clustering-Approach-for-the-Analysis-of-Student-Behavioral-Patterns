# Unsupervised-Ensemble-Clustering-Approach-for-the-Analysis-of-Student-Behavioral-Patterns
Project done as part of Professional Training 
Abstract:
Specialized services and management must understand students’ behavioral patterns 
in a timely and accurate manner. Based on these patterns, we can make targeted 
rules, especially for unexpected patterns. To perform this type of work, a 
questionnaire method is usually used to collect data and analyze students’ behavioral 
states. However, the effectiveness of this method is greatly influenced by the 
timeliness and validity of the feedback data. To address this problem, we propose an 
unsupervised ensemble clustering framework to use student behavioral data to 
discover behavioral patterns. Because the behavioral data produced by students on 
campus are available in real time without intentional bias, clustering analysis can be 
relatively efficient and reliable. The proposed framework extracts behavior features 
from the two perspectives of statistics and entropy and then combines density-based 
spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and k-means algorithms to 
discover behavioral patterns. The results show that the framework can not only detect 
anomalous behavioral patterns but also find mainstream patterns. The findings from 
this research can assist student-related departments in providing better services and 
management, such as psychological consulting and academic guidance.
